## Questions

1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?
Create instantiates the model and saves it to the database; new only makes an instance of the model and does not save it.

2. What command combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create?
.save!

3. What is the default integer column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?
id

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "Kira" in the database?
Cat.create(:name => "Kira")

5. How did you like this homework in comparison with the previous homeworks?
I thought this homework was fairly simple yet was comprehensive enough to teach me the basics of Rails models and migrations. It was open-ended enough to let me play around with Rails on my own without too much hand-holding and it was great. I thought it was about the same as the previous homeworks.
